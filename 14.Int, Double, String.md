# Int, Double, String

## Description

Write a program that, depending on the first line of the input, reads an  **int**,  **double**  or  **string**  variable.

-   If the variable is  **int**  or  **double**, the program increases it by one.
-   If the variable is a  **string**, the program appends  *****  at the end.
-   Print the result at the console. Use switch statement.

## Input

-   On the first line you will receive the type of input as string in the following form:
    -   **integer**  for  **int**
    -   **real**  for  **double**
    -   **text**  for  **string**
-   On the second line you will be given the value of the variable.

## Output

-   Write a single line on the console - the value transformed according to the rules from the description.
    -   Print all  **double**  variables with exactly 2-digit precision after the floating point.  _Example:_  0.99

## Constraints

-   The input will always be valid and in the described format.
-   All input numbers will be between -1000 and 1000.
