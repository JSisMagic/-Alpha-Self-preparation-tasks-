Write a program that finds the most frequent number in an array of  **N**elements.

## Input

-   On the next  **N**  lines the numbers of the array will be given

## Output

-   Print the most frequent number and how many time it is repeated
    -   Output should be  `REPEATING_NUMBER (REPEATED_TIMES times)`

## Constraints

-   1 <=  **N**  <= 1024
-   0 <=  **each number in the array**  <= 10000
-   There will be only one most frequent number
