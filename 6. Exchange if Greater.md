# Exchange if Greater

## Description

Write a program that reads two double values from the console  **A**  and  **B**, stores them in variables and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second one. Use an if-statement. As a result print the values of the variables  **A**  and  **B**, separated by a space.

## Input

-   On the first line, you will receive the value of  **A**
-   On the second line, you will receive the value of  **B**

## Output

-   On the only output line, print the values of the two variables, separated by a whitespace

## Constraints

-   **A**  and  **B**  will always be valid real numbers between -100 and 100
